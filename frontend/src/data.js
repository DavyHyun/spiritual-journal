    content:
      "Being like-minded doesn't necessarily mean agreeing on every detail but rather striving towards common goals and values, such as peace, understanding, and mutual respect. The emphasis on being sympathetic, loving one another, compassionate, and humble underscores the importance of putting others' needs and feelings at par with or even above our own. These qualities foster a supportive environment where everyone feels valued and understood, which is crucial for building strong, resilient communities.",
    author: "David Hyun",
    verse: "1 Peter 3:1-12",
    passage:
      "Finally, all of you, be like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be compassionate and humble. 9 Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult. On the contrary, repay evil with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing. 10 For,“Whoever would love life and see good days must keep their tongue from evil and their lips from deceitful speech.",
